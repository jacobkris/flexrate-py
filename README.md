# flexrate-py
Python implementation of generic multirate filter with arbitrary conversion rates. 

# Description
This project, developed as a part of a master thesis at NTNU Trondheim, serves as a high-level implementation for generic multirate filter. Designed as a precursor to the eventual FPGA implementation, as the python solution provides a framework. The master thesis is carried out under the institute for Electronic Systems at NTNU.
